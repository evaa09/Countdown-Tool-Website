## Challenges Encountered

1. **Video Playback Issues**  
   - Some browsers **prevent autoplay with sound**, so I had to **mute videos** by default.  

2. **Limited CSS Knowledge**  
   - Initially struggled with **positioning and styling** but used this project as a learning opportunity.  
   - Experimented with different **CSS properties** to enhance the design.

## Future Improvements & Scaling Considerations

If this project were to be **scaled into a production-ready website**, I would:  
- **Refactor the JavaScript** into multiple files for better **code organization and reusability**.  
- **Add a welcome pop-up** explaining the websiteâ€™s functionality to new users.  
- **Optimize for performance** by testing across various browsers and ensuring best coding practices.
- **Add Additional Functionality** to expand the website's functionality to new users.
